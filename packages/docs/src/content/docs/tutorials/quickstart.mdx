This guide will lead you through displaying simple scenes using wanim, a web engine for mathematical animations, inspired by [manim](https://www.manim.community/).

We will install the library and create a `WanimScene`, which acts as a container for running a scripted animation. To this we will add a circle, which should animate its entry. Then we will extend this animation by morphing the circle into a square. This will give you an introduction to wanim's animation engine. [...]

## Installation

<Aside type="danger">This is pre-written for the future - we don't actually have anything published yet.</Aside>

You can install wanim in two ways:

### Package Manager

Via your favorite package manager:

<Tabs syncKey="packagemanager">
    <TabItem label="npm">
        <Code code="npm install wanim" lang="console" />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="yarn">
        <Code code="yarn add wanim" lang="console" />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can then import the library in your JavaScript code:

```js
import { wanim, WanimScene } from "wanim";
```

### `<script>` Tag

You can also import wanim directly into the web page using a `<script>` tag. If you are using vanilla JavaScript without a build system, this approach is probably for you.

You can use the modern `import` syntax:

```html
<script type="module">
    import { wanim, WanimScene } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/wanim@latest/+esm";
</script>
```

Or you can add `Wanim` as a global variable using the legacy include:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/wanim@latest/dist/wanim.js"></script>
<script>
    const { wanim, WanimScene } = Wanim;
</script>
```

## Create a circle

In your JavaScript code add the following segment, which creates a pink circle in a fullscreen scene.

```ts
class CreateCircle extends WanimScene {
    async run() {
        const circle = this.add(new Circle(0, 0, 2));
        circle.setFill("pink", 0.5);
        await this.play(Create(circle));
    }
}

wanim(CreateCircle);
```

<CreateCircleExample client:load />
