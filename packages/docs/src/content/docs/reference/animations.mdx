title: Animations

Animations are the lifeblood of this library, allowing you to bring your visualizations to life. They are built using
tweens, which are sequences of changes over time that can be applied to various attributes of `WObject`s.

## Common Attributes

[Common attributes](/reference/objects/#common-attributes) can be animated directly via:

```ts {5-6}
const circle = new Circle(-2, 0);
circle.fill("yellow");
circle.show();

// animate the x-coordinate to 4 over 1 second with the specified ease
await this.play(circle.animate.x(4, 1).ease("inOutSine"));
```

## Tweens

A tween is used to animate properties over a specified duration. You can create a `WTween` instance using the `tween` function:

```ts
const square = this.add(new Square(0, 0, 2));
await this.play(
    tween()
        .onUpdate((t) => square.x(lerp(0, 2, t)))
        .ease("inOutSine"),
);
```

Alternatively, we have already seen that `WObject`s have a built-in animator for their properties:

```ts
const square = this.add(new Square(0, 0, 2));
await this.play(square.animate.x(2, 1).ease("inOutSine"));
```

Underneath, they use a `WTweener` to animate the specified property.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts
let value = 0;
const tween = tweener(() => value, (v) => (value = v), 1, 1);
```

### Sequences

Multiple tweens can be composed together using sequences. A sequence allows you to chain multiple animations, control their timing, and create more complex effects.

```ts
const square = this.add(new Square(-2, 0, 2));
square.fill("red");
square.scale([0, 0]);
square.show();

await this.play(
    sequence()
        .append(square.animate.scale([1, 1], 1).ease("outElastic"))
        .wait(0.5)
        .append(square.animate.x(2, 1).ease("inOutSine"))
        .join(square.animate.fill("green", 0.5))
        .append(square.animate.scale([0, 0], 1).ease("inOutSine"))
        .join(square.animate.rotate(180, 1).ease("inOutSine")),
);
```

You can also use `.callback(...)` to insert custom logic or `.wait(...)` to pause the sequence for a specified duration or until the specified callback resolves.

## Pre-defined Animations

Apart from [animating common attributes](#common-attributes), you can also use pre-defined
animations to easily compose more complex effects.
