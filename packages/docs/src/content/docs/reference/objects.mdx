Any rendered vector element in the scene is a `WObject`. These objects serve as the building blocks for creating and
manipulating visual elements in the scene. They can be transformed, styled, and animated to suit various needs.

`WObject`s share a <span id="common-attributes">common set of attributes</span>, which can be get, set and (therefore) animated, namely
`x`, `y`, `scaleX`, `scaleY`, `rotate`, `opacity`, `fillColor`, `fillOpacity`, `strokeWidth` and `strokeColor`.

There also exist sugar properties in the form of `position` and `scale`, which allow simultaneous
assignment of similar attributes.

For further information on animating the above attributes, refer to the [Animations](../animations) section.

## Groups

These objects hold other `WObject`s as their children, acting as containers for organizing scenes.

```ts
import { WGroup, WObject } from "wanim";

const stars: Star[] = [];
const group = new WGroup();
this.add(group);

for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    const star = new Star(-3 + i * 3, 0);
    star.fill = "yellow";
    star.show();
    stars.push(star);
    group.add(star);
}
```

## Paths

The majority of graphical elements in wanim are based on paths defined using a `WPathObject` to ensure high resolution and a way to define common effects.
They can be initialized using SVG path definitions or from a set of points or cubic bezier nodes.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts
import { WPath, WPathObject } from "wanim";

const pathA = new WPathObject();
pathA.path = new WPath(
    // these quadruples represent the starting point, first and
    // second controls points and the end point of the curve.
    [[-1.2, 1.3], [-0.4, -1.8], [1.1, 0.6], [0.5, -1.0]]
    [[0.5, -1.0], [-0.3, -0.2], [1.9, -1.7], [1.8, 1.6]]
)

// or ...
const pathB = WPathObject.fromSVGPath("M -1.2 1.3 C -0.4 -1.8, 1.1 0.6, 0.5 -1.0 C -0.3 -0.2, 1.9 -1.7, 1.8 1.6")
```

## Basic Shapes

There are several pre-defined shapes that you can use.

| Shape         | Parameters       |
| :------------ | :--------------- |
| Circle        | Radius           |
| Square        | Half-side length |
| Line          | Start, End       |
| Regular N-gon | Sides, Radius    |
| Star          | Tips, Radius     |
| Dot           |                  |

## Text

### Regular Text

TODO.

### LaTeX

Wanim supports LaTeX rendering using the `WTex` class. This allows you to display mathematical expressions using familiar syntax.

```ts
const tex = this.add(new WTex("f(z) = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi i} \\oint_C \\frac{f(\\zeta)}{\\zeta - z} \\, d\\zeta"));
await tex.rendered;
await this.play(Create(tex));
```

<Aside type="caution">
    When LaTeX code is first rendered, the MathJax API must be loaded. Therefore it's best to await the `rendered`
    promise before using the text in animations.
