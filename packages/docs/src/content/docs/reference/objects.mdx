import { GroupsExample } from "../../../examples/groups.jsx";

`WObject`s are the stars of wanim - they represent any rendered vector element in the scene.

## `WGroup`s

These objects hold other `WObject`s as their children, acting as containers for organizing scenes.

<GroupsExample client:load />

## `WPathObject`s

These represent SVG paths. They can be initialized using SVG path definitions or from a set of points or cubic bezier nodes.

```ts

```
